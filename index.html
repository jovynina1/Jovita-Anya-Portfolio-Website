          <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
          <p>
            I am a Frontend Developer who likes to build nice and simple
            websites using HTML and CSS - my strongest skills.<br />
            Coding excites me, especially when i see my ideas come to life on
            the screen, it's kind of like making good jollof that everyone loves
            to eat!<br />
            I also have basic knowledge of JavaScript and i am continously
            growing my skills in JavaScript and some of it's frameworks like
            React. <br />I understand Wordpress but rarely work with it because
            i enjoy coding.<br />
            When i am not busy bringing websites to life, you can find me
            multitasking as a virtual assistant,<br />
            helping individuals and businesses stay organized (because let's
            face it, we all need a little help sometimes), <br />or dreaming up
            the next strategy on how to grow my existing retail clothing
            business. <br />If you ever need a website, some virtual assistance
            or even just a good laugh about the joys of coding life , I'm your
            Person!
